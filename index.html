        <h3>Do owls have eyeballs?</h3>
        <div class="info">
          <p>
            What they have instead are better described as eye tubes. Since they
            can't move these tubes back and forth, owls have developed
            incredible neck flexibility to be able to see the world around them.
            They can turn their heads a whopping 270 degrees, whereas humans can
            only manage about 180. As a result, owls have a special blood vessel
            system in their heads to keep fresh blood circulating to the brain
            when a quick head turn cuts off circulation.

        <h3>How do baby giraffes sleep?</h3>
        <div class="info">
          <p>
            While adult giraffes usually sleep standing up, baby giraffes will
            get a bit more comfortable. They hunker down on the ground and take
            advantage of their extra-flexible necks, twisting around to plop
            their noggins on their own behinds. It doesn't look especially
            comfortable, but it sure does look cute!

        <h3>How long your hair grow in a lifetime?</h3>
        <div class="info">
          <p>
            The average person will grow 590 miles of hair in their lifetime,
            according to The Express. Presumably this is cumulative of each hair
            on your body laid end to end. Nose hairs alone contribute 6.5 feet
            of the total.

          What is a does a length of a day is on Venus as compared to on Earth?
        </h3>
        <div class="info">
          <p>
            On Earth, it only seems like a day can last longer than a whole
            year. In reality, our planet rotates on its axis once every 24 hours
            and makes one complete revolution around the sun every 365.25 days.
